# Module 5 Challenge

This project was designed for us to create a workday planner that can add and save user 
input in time block, as well as color-code what time blocks are past, present and future. 

I was able to accomplish this by:
    -Adding the full amount of time blocks into the HTML
    -creating functions using J Query to update the time and time blocks
    -Utilizing Local Storage to save user input
    -Synced date ID with calendar to keep page current

This was one of the simpler tasks since the HTML was a lot of 
coping and pasting the time blocks and just changing the text and display.
The J Query functions were easier to figure out and fairly minimal.
